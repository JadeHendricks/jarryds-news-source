                            Over the course of a few years Jarryd has had a lot of interest in keeping up with all events around the world.
                            Why? is probably what you're thinking to yourself at the moment. The answer? I'm not sure either. You gotta ask him (j.manuel@gmail.com).
                            Let me know what he says so I can update this about us page.

                            Jarryd loves articles, oh yes he does. So a website with all his news one click away was perfect for him. He loves it! well atleast I think he does.<br />
                            In short I'm actually just making this site for him so that he can keep me posted on all Ricky Martin news.
